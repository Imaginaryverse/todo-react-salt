A basic todo app built in React. Uses React Hooks and Sass.
This was a weekend project for School of Applied Technology's fullstack JavaScript bootcamp.

The goal was to write a simple todo app that allowed users to:

1. Add todos
2. Toggle "done"-states of todos
3. Remove todos

Additional features such as being able to click on a todo to expand it in order to view longer descriptions, being able to edit the content of a todo, being able to clear the entire list of todos and being able to change the color theme of the app were not required but were added for practice and funsies.

Enjoy!
