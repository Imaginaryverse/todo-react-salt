A basic todo app built in React. Uses React Hooks and Sass.
This was a weekend project for School of Applied Technology's fullstack JavaScript bootcamp.

The goal was to write a simple todo app that allowed users to:

1. Add todos
2. Toggle "done"-states of todos
3. Remove todos

Additional features such as being able to edit the content of a todo and being able to clear the entire list of todos were not required but were added for practice and funsies.

Enjoy!
